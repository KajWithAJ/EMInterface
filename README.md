# EMInterface
Slightly adjusted version of the [original EMInterface plugin by k1lly0u](https://umod.org/plugins/eminterface)

## What's different?

I've added an `Organizer` tab to the `/event` menu that will allow players with the `eventmanager.organizer` permission to open events.
I've also added a checkbox when creating or editing an event whether players with the organizer permission can open that particular event.

## Dependencies

This requires some changes in the `EventManager` plugin, my modified version of the plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/KajWithAJ/EventManager).
